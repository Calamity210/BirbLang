# BirbDocs

The BirbDocs website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://v2.docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

The build and installation instructions can be followed using both npm or yarn. Any of those should work.

### Installation

```shell
# Yarn
$ yarn

# npm
$ npm install
```

### Local Development

```shell
# Yarn
$ yarn start

# npm
$ npm run start
```

This command starts a local development server and open up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```shell
# Yarn
$ yarn build

# npm
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.
